# 🌍 Explora Ciudades Feeds (RSS & Atom)

This repository hosts the official syndication feeds for **Explora Ciudades**, a travel blog providing dynamic tips, practical guides, and optimized itineraries to explore countries and cities in a faster, more fun, and more efficient way.

## 📋 Feed Formats
To ensure compatibility with all modern readers and aggregators, we provide two formats:

1.  **RSS 2.0:** The classic standard for broad compatibility.

* **Master Itineraries:** Step-by-step routes like Japan's "Golden Route."
* **City Spotlights:** Highlights of iconic destinations like Buenos Aires.

## 🔮 Future Updates
We are constantly working to expand our content. In the near future, we will be adding:
* **Multilingual Support:** We are launching an English version of the website to reach a global audience.
* **New Destinations:** Comprehensive guides for emerging travel spots.
* **Hidden Gems:** Deep dives into off-the-beaten-path locations across Europe, Asia, and the Americas.
